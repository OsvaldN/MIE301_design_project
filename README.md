## MIE301 Final Project: Walking Mechanism Design & Analysis

This is the final group project for the undergraduate course *MIE301: Kinematics & Dynamics of Machinery* at the University of Toronto.

The Project required designing and modeling single motor walking mechanism with maximum stability; we iterate through potential designs and on our final design create a kinematic model in MATLAB and also a 3D model in SOLIDWORKS.
Please find the MATLAB and CAD models in their respectively named folders, and the report in the Final_Report.pdf

#### Disclaimer for current MIE301 students
This project wasn't worth much of our final grade and we went far beyond expectations by including not only much more involved MATLAB simulations than covered at this stage of undergrad, but also by incuding a full 3D model - which was not required - and still staying within the word limit. If you are a student taking this class now, beware that the TAs do not read any of your code or even your report, as evident by their comments. It was common knowledge in our cohort that the grades received on this assigment were arbitrary.
