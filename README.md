## MIE301 Final Project: Walking Mechanism Design & Analysis

This is the final group project for the undergraduate course *MIE301: Kinematics & Dynamics of Machinery* at the University of Toronto.

The Project required designing and modeling single motor walking mechanism with maximum stability; we iterate through potential designs and on our final design create a kinematic model in MATLAB and also a 3D model in SOLIDWORKS.
Please find the MATLAB and CAD models in their respectively named folders, and the report in the Final_Report.pdf
